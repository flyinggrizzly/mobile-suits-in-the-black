The playbooks offered here are what I imagine makes sense for a game set in the
Universal Century, but it's your table and your game--you should totally play
how you want.

For the existing _Scum and Villainy_ playbooks, I would drop **The Mystic**.
It's a really cool playbook, but a lot of the Way moves don't quite match the
way that mystical things usually work in the UC.

That said, there are some cool things that the Mystic does (like the
**Psy-Blade** move) that feel a lot like what some of Gundam's Newtype
characters do in extremis, so you could totally make it work. It might just be a
more magical Gundam game, and if that's what you want--go nuts!
