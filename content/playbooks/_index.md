The playbooks here were a first attempt, and will change.

Instead of having Newtype playbooks, I'm thinking instead we'll have more
standard playbooks that describe the 'normal' function of a character within the
crew (Ace Pilot, Veteran, and Mechanic will probably stay, for example).

And... in addition to that, I think there will be two or three Veteran Advance
movesets for Newtypes:

- budding Newtype
  - abilities that focus on Kamille, Quess, Lalah, and young Amuro
- Cyber Newtype
  - some combination of Four, Rosamia, Marida Cruz and Gyunei Guss
- Mature Newtype (probably available to both of the previous?)
  - mature Char, mature Amuro, Scirocco, Haman
