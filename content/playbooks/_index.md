There are some new playbooks and moves here--these are some ideas I'm playing
with for moving the game beyond just a _Scum and Villainy_ playset. You are
welcome to use them, but they're still pretty sketchy. It might make more sense
to just cherry-pick their special abilities as Veteran Advances onto the
existing _SaV_ playbooks for now.

For the existing _Scum and Villainy_ playbooks, I would drop **The Mystic**.
It's a really cool playbook, but a lot of the Way moves don't quite match the
way that mystical things usually work in the UC.

One of the focuses for this playset is providing Newtype moves to be taken as
Veteran Advances to replace the Mystic. I'd recommend not counting these against
your three Veteran Advance limit.

That said, there are some cool things that the Mystic does (like the
**Psy-Blade** move) that feel a lot like what some of Gundam's Newtype
characters do in extremis, so you could totally make it work. It might just be a
more magical Gundam game, and if that's what you want--go nuts!
