  description: When you roll Fallout after a mission, you may narrate a
    letter or journal entry your character has written. Describe some of the
    crew's actions or victories in the last sortie, and introduce a new threat
    created by them. Describe how this new threat puts you, your team, or one of
    your team's friends in the crosshairs. The friend can either be a contact,
    an ally, or a member of a resource organization (a financial backer or
    materiel supplier maybe). The GM will start a 4-clock for bringing this new
    threat to bear, and tick it once immediately. This counts as the team's
    Fallout for the mission. You may do this before or after you see the
    result of the normal Fallout roll.
