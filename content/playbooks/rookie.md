  description: When you roll Entanglements after a mission, you may narrate a
    letter or journal entry your character has written. Describe some of the
    crew's actions or victories in the last sortie, and introduce a new threat
    created by them. Describe how this new threat puts you, your team, or one of
    your team's friends in the crosshairs. The friend can either be a contact,
    or a member of a faction your crew has a positive status with. The GM will
    start a 4-clock for bringing this new threat to bear, and tick it once
    immediately. This counts as the team's Entanglement for the mission. You may
    do this before or after you see the result of the normal Entanglement roll.
