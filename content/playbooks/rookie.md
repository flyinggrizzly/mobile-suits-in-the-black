  description: At the beginning of each Downtime, you may narrate a letter or
    journal entry your character has written. Describe some of the actions that
    the team has just taken or victories you have won in the last sortie, and
    reframe how they make you fearful for the future, are changing you, or how
    they might come back to haunt you, another PC, or the team. Once you have
    written the letter, clear up to 3 Stress. This does not count as one of your
    normal downtime actions.
