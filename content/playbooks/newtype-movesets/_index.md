[*Newtypes*](http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/Newtype) are a core part of the
fictions in more than one of the Gundam universes, but nowhere more so than in
the Universal Century.

Most of the time, Newtypes are [spacenoids](/characters/heritage/#spacenoid)
whose minds and souls, unburdened by gravity, have begun to awaken and use all
of human potential. Amuro
