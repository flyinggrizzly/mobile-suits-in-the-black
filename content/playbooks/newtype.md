    When you encounter an obstacle whose true nature is not yet known, you may
    declare that you know that the person really behind it is one of your
    contacts, who is also a Newtype. You feel the pressure of their mind behind
    that door, or around that asteroid. They, of course, sense the your pressure
    on their psyche as well. When acting on this information your position and
    effect are either Desperate-Great, or Controlled-Limited.

    - attack an enemy from a direction they're not expecting
    - attack multiple enemies simultaneously
    - create a field of beam-cannon fire to slow a pursuer down
