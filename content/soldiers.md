# Soldiers

When you play _Against the Titans of War_, you will play pilots, mechanics, technicians,
and other soldiers on a **FRACT** carrier. Each of these characters are unique
individuals, and their own heritages and backgrounds inform their perspectives
on the world and the war.

## Actions and Attributes

When you play your Soldiers, you will be rolling dice to take **actions**, and
using your **attributes** to **resist** consequences. The [_Blades in the Dark_
SRD](https://bladesinthedark.com/basics/) has all the information you'll need on
action rolls, position and effect, and the consequences you might suffer, and
how to resist them with your attributes.

There are some changes though. The **actions** in _Against the Titans of War_
are...

<div class="three-col-container">
  <div class-"three-col">
    <table>
      <tr><th>Insight</th></tr>
      <tr><td>Hunt</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Study</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Rig</td></tr>
      <tr><td>{{< attr-adj-icon >}} Canny</td></tr>
    </table>
  </div>
  <div class-"three-col">
    <table>
      <tr><th>Prowess</th></tr>
      <tr><td>Finesse</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Skirmish</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Maneuver</td></tr>
      <tr><td>{{< attr-adj-icon >}} Practiced</td></tr>
    </table>
  </div>
  <div class-"three-col">
    <table>
      <tr><th>Resolve</th></tr>
      <tr><td>Command</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Consort</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Attune</td></tr>
      <tr><td>{{< attr-adj-icon >}} Tempered</td></tr>
    </table>
  </div>
</div>

## Veteran Adjectives

The {{<attr-adj-icon >}} marks that the adjective is not a normal action you
roll. These are **Veteran Adjectives**. Your Soldiers earn these special adjectives as they grow and gain
experience.

When your Soldier is piloting their **FRACT**, any action roll will have **reduced effect**
until the Soldier has the veteran adjective in action's attribute.

Once they have it, they get an extra die when using that attribute to resist as
if they had dots in an action as well as full effect when piloting and using
actions in the same attribute as the adjective.

### Earning Veteran Adjectives

Soldiers don't start with any **Veteran Adjectives**, except for the **Ace** and
**Veteran** playbooks.

**Veteran Adjectives** are earned by making **desperate** actions
when piloting your **FRACT**. Taking a **Veteran Adjective** requires filling the
attribute XP track **twice**.
