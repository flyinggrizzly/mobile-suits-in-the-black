In order to play _Against the Titans of War_, you should already be familiar
with the _Blades in the Dark's_ system, the rules for which are available for
free on the [_Blades_ SRD](https://bladesinthedark.com/basics)[^1].

Specifically, you should know how the following work:

- the [core system](https://bladesinthedark.com/core-system)
- what [**actions** and **attributes**](https://bladesinthedark.com/actions-attributes)
    are (the actions are different in _Titans_, and there's an extra category of **veteran
    adjectives**, but the core idea is the same)
- [**stress** and **trauma**](https://bladesinthedark.com/stress-trauma)
- the [action roll](https://bladesinthedark.com/action-roll)
- [**effect**](https://bladesinthedark.com/effect), as well as [setting **position** and
    **effect**](https://bladesinthedark.com/setting-position-effect)
- [**consequences** and **harm**](https://bladesinthedark.com/consequences-harm) and
    [**resistance** and **armor**](https://bladesinthedark.com/resistance-armor)
- [clocks](https://bladesinthedark.com/progress-clocks)
- [fortune rolls](https://bladesinthedark.com/fortune-roll)
- how to [gather information](https://bladesinthedark.com/gathering-information)
- [planning missions](https://bladesinthedark.com/planning-engagement)
- how to [work as a team](https://bladesinthedark.com/teamwork)
- how the base [Downtime](https://bladesinthedark.com/downtime) system works

Once you're familiar with _Blades_, it's time to dive into the _Titans_ rules.
Players and MCs should all familiarize themselves with

- [the Resistance](/resistance/)
- who the [Soldiers](/soldiers/) and [Tactical officers](/factions/tactical-officers/) are
- what [Tactical does](/tactical/) does
- how [missions and engagement](/missions-tier-resources/) are different in
    _Titans_
- how the [factions](/factions/) support and hinder the Resistance

At least one of you should know these pretty well before the first session, but
everyone should have an idea of what these are and what they do.

**And when you're ready, follow the [first session
guide!](/getting-started/first-session/)**


[^1]: At some point in the future I will add all of the rules directly here, but for now, please use the SRD.
