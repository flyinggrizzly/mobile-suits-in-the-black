title: Differences from Blades in the Dark and Scum and Villainy
weight: 100

So you've played _Blades in the Dark_ or _Scum and Villainy_ (or any of the
other awesome Forged in the Dark games) before...

### Claims become Resources

Claims are replaced by **Resources**. You still undertake missions to secure
these, but it is more costly.

Each Resource has a Resource Value, from 1 to 4.

### Engagement

Engagement rolls are a lot harder. There's a little bit of a poker game
involved--you will (almost) always automatically fail your Engagement roll
unless you've staked one of your Resources as the thing that is pivotal to your
mission. Then you get 0d6.

Once you've anted up to 0d6, you need to stake more resources, the total value
of which is equal to the target of your mission. This gets you to 1d6.

After that, it's Engagement as usual--name (other) resources, or friends,
allies, rivals, etc who are aiding or interfering. You can also stake further
resources to increase your crew's Tier for the mission 2 for 1.

The GM should say during planning what the Tier of the mission's target is.
As a rule of thumb, a mission to secure a Resource should have a Tier equal to
that Resources value.

### Crew Tier

Your crew's tier is determined by the total value of resources you have secured.
Every 6 resource value is one tier.

There is no rep.

### Heat is replaced by Friction, Entanglements become Fallout

There is no Heat or Wanted level. Instead, during missions you rack up
**Friction**, which determines which Fallout table to roll on at the beginning
of downtime.

Instead of rolling your Wanted level on the Fallout table, you roll your crew's
Tier. Fallout is about what your enemy throws at you, so the more successful
and dangerous you prove, the worse fallout will be.

Each ship/crew-type has its own set of Fallout tables.
