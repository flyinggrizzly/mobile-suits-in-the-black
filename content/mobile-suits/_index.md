Mobile Suits are giant, usually humanoid, robotic warmachines, and the most
important military innovation in the Universal Century. They have become
necessary because the interference caused by [Minovsky
particles](http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/Gundam_Wiki%3ATechnology#The_Minovsky_Particle)
makes long-range targeting ineffective.

In _MSitB_, they are modelled as the _personal vehicles_ listed as an available
upgrade for the _Cerberus_ ship (page 131), with some starting stats provided.

In Gundam series, there are roughly three 'classes'[^1] of MS:

- mass-production units ('grunt' suits like the [MS-06 Zaku
II](http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/MS-06_Zaku_II) or [RGM-79 GM](http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/RGM-79_GM))
- performance, personal, or technology test units (high-performance suits like
the [RMG-79N GM Custom](http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/RGM-79N_GM_Custom), [MSA-099
Rick Dias](http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/Rick_Dias), [MS-14Fs Gelgoog
Commander-type](http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/MS-14Fs_Gelgoog_Marine_Commander_Type),
[RX-79 [G] Gundam
Ground-type](http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/RX-79%EF%BC%BBG%EF%BC%BD_Gundam_Ground_Type),
and [RGZ-95 ReZEL](http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/Rezel))
- unique and personal suits for ace pilots (favorites like the
[RX-78-2 Gundam](http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/RX-78-2_Gundam), [MSN-04
Sazabi](http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/MSN-04_Sazabi), [MSZ-06 Zeta
Gundam](http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/MSZ-006_Zeta_Gundam), and [RX-93 Î½ ('Nu')
Gundam](http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/RX-93_%CE%BD_Gundam))

## Mobile Suit system scores

For the purposes of _MSitB_, the three MS classes have different system score sets:

- a mass-production unit will have 8 points to spend on systems, with no system score higher than 3
  - [3, 2, 2, 1] and [3, 3, 1, 1] are both valid mass-production system score sets
- a performance unit will have 11 points to spend on systems, with at most one system score of 4
  - [3, 3, 3, 2], [4, 3, 3, 1], and [4, 3, 2, 2] are all valid performance or personal system score sets
- a unique unit will have 13 points to spend on systems
  - [4, 4, 3, 2], [4, 3, 3, 3], and [4, 4, 4, 1] are all valid unique system score sets

Which number is allocated to which system is a question of which MS you are piloting (though if you don't
like the way I've statted these mobile suits, you are free to make your own!)

## Statting your own Mobile Suit

Totally. Do it. There are so many damn MS, *especially* once you hit the [Gryps
Conflict](http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/Gryps_Conflict) and [First Neo Zeon
War](http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/First_Neo_Zeon_War), that there's no chance I'm going to make stats
for each one. I'm sorry if I missed your favorite.

The trick to doing this is understanding that one mobile suit will be of a different class based on when
your game is taking place. The Gelgoog is absolutely a performance suit during
the [One Year War](http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/One_Year_War)... but that same MS
if piloted during the Gryps War would be a grunt unit at best.

Another thing to bear in mind is whether the MS is for Newtype use. If it is,
you'll probably want a **Comms** system score of at least two, so you can have
both normal comms equipment, and a *psycommu* set up.

## Mobile Suit special moves

Each MS should have one special move that sets it apart from the other MS in its
class. For example, the MS-06 Zaku II has the special move _Ubiquitous_, which
grants a bonus die on repair rolls because its parts are so common. The RGM-79
GM, another MS in the same class, instead has _Titanium Armor_, which grants it
special armor to spend when hit by a beam attack and grants it advantage in
speed when acting against another MS of the same class.

If the MS is intended for Newtype use, think about using a special move that
ties into the pilot's abilities. I've given the MSZ-006 Zeta the _Biocomputer_
move, which allows a Newtype pilot to push themself to temporarily increase one
of the MS systems to 5, or to communicate with a friend or foe on the
battlefield uninterrupted by conflict for a moment.

These special moves reflect the specific characteristics of the mobile suit, and
tell us a story about them.

[^1]: For the purposes of the game, this is close enough. And of course there's bleed between the categories. For example, we could argue that the RX-78-2 Gundam was a top-level suit at the beginning of the series, but by the end it was more of a 'performance' suit, and it was Amuro's abilities that continued to set he and it apart. And MS like the [MSN-00100 Hyaku Shiki](http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/MSN-00100_Hyaku_Shiki) could be put into either the top or mid tiers, but it would depend on what kind of Zeta story you were trying to tell.
