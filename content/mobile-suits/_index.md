Mobile Suits are giant, usually humanoid, robotic warmachines, and the most
important military innovation in the Universal Century. They have become
necessary because the interference caused by [Minovsky
particles](http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/Gundam_Wiki%3ATechnology#The_Minovsky_Particle)
makes long-range targeting ineffective.

In _MSitB_, they are modelled as the _personal vehicles_ listed as an available
upgrade for the _Cerberus_ ship (page 131), with some starting stats provided.

In Gundam series, there are roughly three 'classes'[^1] of MS:

- mass-production units ('grunt' suits like the [MS-06 Zaku
II](http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/MS-06_Zaku_II) or [RGM-79 GM](http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/RGM-79_GM))
- performance, personal, or technology test units (high-performance suits like the [MSA-099
Rick Dias](http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/Rick_Dias), [MS-14Fs Gelgoog
Commander-type](http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/MS-14Fs_Gelgoog_Marine_Commander_Type),
[RX-79 [G] Gundam
Ground-type](http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/RX-79%EF%BC%BBG%EF%BC%BD_Gundam_Ground_Type),
and [RGZ-95 ReZEL](http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/Rezel))
- unique and personal suits for ace pilots (favorites like the
[RX-78-2 Gundam](http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/RX-78-2_Gundam), [MSN-04
Sazabi](http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/MSN-04_Sazabi), [MSZ-06 Zeta
Gundam](http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/MSZ-006_Zeta_Gundam), and [RX-93 Î½ ('Nu')
Gundam](http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/RX-93_%CE%BD_Gundam))


[^1]: For the purposes of the game, this is close enough. And of course there's bleed between the categories. For example, we could argue that the RX-78-2 Gundam was a top-level suit at the beginning of the series, but by the end it was more of a 'performance' suit, and it was Amuro's abilities that continued to set he and it apart. And suits like the [MSN-00100 Hyaku Shiki](http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/MSN-00100_Hyaku_Shiki) could be put into either the top of mid tiers, but it would depend on what kind of Zeta story you were trying to tell.
