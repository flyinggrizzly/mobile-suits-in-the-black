Mobile Suits are giant, usually humanoid, robotic warmachines, and the most
important military innovation in the Universal Century. They have become
necessary because the interference caused by [Minovsky
particles](http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/Gundam_Wiki%3ATechnology#The_Minovsky_Particle)
makes long-range targeting ineffective.

In _MSitB_, they are modelled as the _personal vehicles_ listed as an available
upgrade for the _Cerberus_ ship (page 131), with some starting stats provided.

In Gundam series, there are roughly three 'classes'[^1] of MS:

- mass-production units ('grunt' suits like the [MS-06 Zaku
II](http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/MS-06_Zaku_II) or [RGM-79 GM](http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/RGM-79_GM))
- performance, personal, or technology test units (high-performance suits like
the [RMG-79N GM Custom](http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/RGM-79N_GM_Custom), [MSA-099
Rick Dias](http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/Rick_Dias), [MS-14Fs Gelgoog
Commander-type](http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/MS-14Fs_Gelgoog_Marine_Commander_Type),
[RX-79 [G] Gundam
Ground-type](http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/RX-79%EF%BC%BBG%EF%BC%BD_Gundam_Ground_Type),
and [RGZ-95 ReZEL](http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/Rezel))
- unique and personal suits for ace pilots (favorites like the
[RX-78-2 Gundam](http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/RX-78-2_Gundam), [MSN-04
Sazabi](http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/MSN-04_Sazabi), [MSZ-06 Zeta
Gundam](http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/MSZ-006_Zeta_Gundam), and [RX-93 Î½ ('Nu')
Gundam](http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/RX-93_%CE%BD_Gundam))

## Mobile Suit system scores

The Mobile Suit examples that I've created have different stat blocks for each
class:

a **grunt** or **mass-production** unit's system scores will

- have maximums that total to somewhere between 5 to 8, with no single system
    score over 3
- have starting scores that total to 3 or 4

a **performance** or **test** unit's system scores will

- have maximums that total to 10 or 11, with at most one system
    score of 4
- have starting scores that total to 6 to 8

a **unique** or **custom** unit's scores will

- have maximums that total to 13 or 14
- have starting scores that total to 9 to 12

Which number is allocated to which system is a question of which MS you are piloting (though if you don't
like the way I've statted these mobile suits, you are free to make your own!)

### Statting your own Mobile Suit

Totally. Do it. There are so many damn MS, *especially* once you hit the [Gryps
Conflict](http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/Gryps_Conflict) and [First Neo Zeon
War](http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/First_Neo_Zeon_War), that there's no chance I'm going to make stats
for each one. I'm sorry if I missed your favorite.

The trick to doing this is understanding that one mobile suit will be of a different class based on when
your game is taking place. The Gelgoog is absolutely a performance suit during
the [One Year War](http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/One_Year_War)... but that same MS
if piloted during the Gryps War would be a grunt unit at best.

Another thing to bear in mind is whether the MS is for Newtype use. If it is,
you'll probably want a **Comms** system score of at least two, so you can have
both normal comms equipment, and a *psycommu* set up.

## Advancing, improving, and upgrading your Mobile Suit

Despite the fact that mobile suits in _Mobile Suits in the Black_ are
mechanically pretty much identical to the crew ship from core _Scum and
Villainy_, they have different rules for upgrades and advancement. This is
because the crew ship upgrades are earned by crew XP, which doesn't accrue for
your mobile suit.

When your crew earns a Crew advance, one of the upgrades available to you is
"Mobile Suit upgrades". When the crew takes this upgrade (and it can be taken as
many times as you like, including twice at once by spending both upgrades
earned from a crew advance), each mobile suit gets one upgrade box to spend on
its own systems, upgrades, or modules.

You don't have to spend these upgrades on the mobile suits immediately--if
you want to improve a mobile suit system to quality 4, for example, you'll need
to save up four upgrades to do it.

You will also need to leave the mobile suit in a fully equipped hangar (possibly
at Von Braun or at La Vie en Rose) while the work is done. This is a great time
for a non-mobile suit based score!

### Increasing systems scores

Increasing a mobile suit's system scores requires you to spend upgrades at a
cost of 1 upgrade per level of new score. So going from a score of 0 to 1 would
cost one upgrade, and from 2 to 3 would cost three upgrades.

### Adding new modules

Adding new modules works the same way it does for a ship--spend the required
number of upgrades on the module, and spend some time in drydock.

## Mobile Suit special moves

Each MS should have one special move that sets it apart from the other MS in its
class. For example, the MS-06 Zaku II has the special move _Ubiquitous_, which
grants a bonus die on repair rolls because its parts are so common. The RGM-79
GM, another MS in the same class, instead has _Titanium Armor_, which grants it
special armor to spend when hit by a beam attack and grants it advantage in
speed when acting against another MS of the same class.

If the MS is intended for Newtype use, it might get a second special move. Think
about using a special move that ties into the pilot's abilities. I've given the
MSZ-006 Zeta the _Biocomputer_ move, which allows a Newtype pilot to push
themself to temporarily increase one of the MS systems to 5.

These special moves reflect the specific characteristics of the mobile suit, and
tell us a story about them.

[^1]: For the purposes of the game, this is close enough. And of course there's bleed between the categories. For example, we could argue that the RX-78-2 Gundam was a top-level suit at the beginning of the series, but by the end it was more of a 'performance' suit, and it was Amuro's abilities that continued to set he and it apart. And MS like the [MSN-00100 Hyaku Shiki](http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/MSN-00100_Hyaku_Shiki) could be put into either the top or mid tiers, but it would depend on what kind of Zeta story you were trying to tell.
