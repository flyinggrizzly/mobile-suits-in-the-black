Mobile Suits are giant, usually humanoid, robotic warmachines, and the most
important military innovation in the Universal Century. They have become
necessary because the interference caused by [Minovsky
particles](http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/Gundam_Wiki%3ATechnology#The_Minovsky_Particle)
makes long-range targeting ineffective.

In _MSitB_, they are modelled as the _personal vehicles_ listed as an available
upgrade for the _Cerberus_ ship (page 131), with some starting stats provided.

In Gundam series, there are roughly three 'classes'[^1] of MS:

- mass-production units ('grunt' suits like the [MS-06 Zaku
II](http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/MS-06_Zaku_II) or [RGM-79 GM](http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/RGM-79_GM))
- performance, personal, or technology test units (high-performance suits like
the [RMG-79N GM Custom](http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/RGM-79N_GM_Custom), [MSA-099
Rick Dias](http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/Rick_Dias), [MS-14Fs Gelgoog
Commander-type](http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/MS-14Fs_Gelgoog_Marine_Commander_Type),
[RX-79 [G] Gundam
Ground-type](http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/RX-79%EF%BC%BBG%EF%BC%BD_Gundam_Ground_Type),
and [RGZ-95 ReZEL](http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/Rezel))
- unique and personal suits for ace pilots (favorites like the
[RX-78-2 Gundam](http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/RX-78-2_Gundam), [MSN-04
Sazabi](http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/MSN-04_Sazabi), [MSZ-06 Zeta
Gundam](http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/MSZ-006_Zeta_Gundam), and [RX-93 Î½ ('Nu')
Gundam](http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/RX-93_%CE%BD_Gundam))

## Mobile Suit system scores

The Mobile Suit examples that I've created have different stat blocks for each
class:

- a **grunt** or **mass-production** unit's system scores will
  - have maximums that total to somewhere between 5 to 8, with no single system
      score over 3
  - have starting scores that total to 3 or 4

- a **performance** or **test** unit's system scores will
  - have maximums that total to 10 or 11, with at most one system
      score of 4
  - have starting scores that total to 6 to 8

- a **unique** or **custom** unit's scores will
  - have maximums that total to 13 or 14
  - have starting scores that total to 9 to 12

Which number is allocated to which system is a question of which MS you are piloting (though if you don't
like the way I've statted these mobile suits, you are free to make your own!)

### Statting your own Mobile Suit

Totally. Do it. There are so many damn MS, *especially* once you hit the [Gryps
Conflict](http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/Gryps_Conflict) and [First Neo Zeon
War](http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/First_Neo_Zeon_War), that there's no chance I'm going to make stats
for each one. I'm sorry if I missed your favorite.

The trick to doing this is understanding that one mobile suit will be of a different class based on when
your game is taking place. The Gelgoog is absolutely a performance suit during
the [One Year War](http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/One_Year_War)... but that same MS
if piloted during the Gryps War would be a grunt unit at best.

Another thing to bear in mind is whether the MS is for Newtype use. If it is,
you'll probably want a **Comms** system score of at least two, so you can have
both normal comms equipment, and a *psycommu* set up.

## Advancing, improving, and upgrading your Mobile Suit

Despite the fact that mobile suits in _Mobile Suits in the Black_ are
mechanically pretty much identical to the crew ship from core _Scum and
Villany_, they have different rules for upgrades and advancement. This is
because the crew ship upgrades are earned by crew XP, which doesn't accrue for
your mobile suit.

### Increasing systems scores

Upgrading your mobile suit's systems is a long-term project. When you have
access to an equipped hangar or depot (or other similar useful facility), you
can work on a project to increase one of your mobile suit's system scores. The
project clock for this is always an 8 clock.

If that system gets damaged in a sortie before the clock is finished, untick 1
segment in addition to marking the system damage.

### Adding new modules

Adding modules to a mobile suit is also a long-term project, but in this case it
is a 6-clock. The normal rules about module capacity based on system score
apply.

If the system that supports the module is damaged before you finish the project,
there isn't a setback to the project, though you might need to repair the system
if it reduced your system's capacity to hold the new module.

## Mobile Suit special moves

Each MS should have one special move that sets it apart from the other MS in its
class. For example, the MS-06 Zaku II has the special move _Ubiquitous_, which
grants a bonus die on repair rolls because its parts are so common. The RGM-79
GM, another MS in the same class, instead has _Titanium Armor_, which grants it
special armor to spend when hit by a beam attack and grants it advantage in
speed when acting against another MS of the same class.

If the MS is intended for Newtype use, think about using a special move that
ties into the pilot's abilities. I've given the MSZ-006 Zeta the _Biocomputer_
move, which allows a Newtype pilot to push themself to temporarily increase one
of the MS systems to 5, or to communicate with a friend or foe on the
battlefield uninterrupted by conflict for a moment.

These special moves reflect the specific characteristics of the mobile suit, and
tell us a story about them.

[^1]: For the purposes of the game, this is close enough. And of course there's bleed between the categories. For example, we could argue that the RX-78-2 Gundam was a top-level suit at the beginning of the series, but by the end it was more of a 'performance' suit, and it was Amuro's abilities that continued to set he and it apart. And MS like the [MSN-00100 Hyaku Shiki](http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/MSN-00100_Hyaku_Shiki) could be put into either the top or mid tiers, but it would depend on what kind of Zeta story you were trying to tell.
