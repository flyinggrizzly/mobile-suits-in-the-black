  description: |
    Any mobile suit equipped with a **psychoframe** that you sortie in can
    deploy **funnels** or **bits**, which are small remote-controlled
    beam-cannons capable of moving themselves around in space at your mental
    command. You can spend Stress, one for one, for any of the following
    effects:

    - attack an enemy from a direction they're not expecting
    - attack multiple enemies simultaneously
    - create a field of beam-cannon fire to slow a pursuer down

This mobile suit is a unique/ace suit in Zeta, but pretty quickly becomes a performance model by the end of ZZ.
