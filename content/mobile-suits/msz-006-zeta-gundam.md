- description: Zeta's biocomputer psycommu allows you to use your Newtype abilities
    to push Zeta or yourself beyond your normal limits. When you push yourself, you
    can either meet a friend or foe for a moment, uninterrupted, in Newtype space,
    **or** temporarily increase the quality of one of Zeta's systems to 5. You still
    gain the normal benefits of pushing.
