War has been ravaging the world and space for decades. Victim becomes aggressor,
aggressor becomes victor, victor becomes victim in a never ending cycle.

Ten years ago the Last War ended. It was supposed to be the last war ever
fought, but now, while the name is the same, it just means it was the last war
we found ourselves in. The Earth Federacy won, and for a while disarmament
seemed to proceed apace.

And then the Federacy created the _Ruishi_, their special forces. The _Ruishi_
are soldiers with special permission to follow any matter they choose, using any
methods they like, to root out the last of the Federacy's enemies. They were
named for the guardian lions of China and Tibet. But you just call them the
Enemy.

Their power corrupted them. Or maybe they were corrupt from the start. It doesn't
matter, either way, it is your job to resist them.

In _Against the Titans of War_, you take on multiple roles in the Resistance.
