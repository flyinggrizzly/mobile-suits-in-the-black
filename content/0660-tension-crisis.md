# Tension and Crisis

Every time a Soldier spends [**Contempt**](/tactical/contempt/), the Resistance
marks the **Tension track**. When the 10th mark is made, you are in **Crisis**.

When the Resistance is in **Crisis**, the organization is consumed in
infighting. Do all of the following:

- discard any unresolved **Orders** and **Riders**. The crisis is all-consuming
    and communications are too unreliable for these to matter anymore
- roll for a **Crisis**
- mark a **Crisis** on the **Crisis track**

## Crises

Roll 1d for each **Crisis** already marked (not including this one):

| Result | Crisis |
| --- | --- |
| **Crit** | The Enemy has turned the leadership of the sponsor faction with the greatest **Strength**. Either they join the Enemy, or lose 9 **Momentum** to resist and deal with the traitors. If this crisis occurs while you are on a mission, it fails immediately. If the sponsor joined the enemy you are immediately attacked by the forces of this new alliance (begin a new mission to deal with the attack as if you had rolled a 1-3 on Engagement). |
| **6** | The Enemy attacks you _now_. If you are on a mission, it does not fail, but they immediately show up. |
| **4/5** | You catch wind that the Enemy is negotiating with one of the sponsor factions. How will you deal with this? All Soldiers get only 1 Downtime action. |
| **1-3** | All Soldiers get only 1 Downtime action in the next Downtime phase because there is so much to do to get everyone back on board. |
