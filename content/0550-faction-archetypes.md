# Faction Archetypes

A faction's archetype is the biggest determining factor in who they are and how
they operate. It is their playbook.

The [**Objectors**](/factions/archetypes/objectors/) are people from the same
organization as the Enemy, who will not stand for what is happening.

The [**Resurgent Defeated**](/factions/archetypes/resurgent-defeated/) are the
losers of the **Last War**, hunted by the Enemy. Their hate burns hotter than
anyone else's.

The [**Corporate Atlas**](/factions/archetypes/corporate-atlas/) is a private
company who supports the **Resistance** both financially and with materiel,
either out of good intention or because the Enemy has blacklisted them from
their market.
