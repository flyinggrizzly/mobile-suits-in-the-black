In _MSitB_, you will play pilots, mechanics, technicians, and other soldiers on
a mobile suit carrier. Each of these characters are unique individuals, and
their own heritages and backgrounds inform their perspectives on the world and
the war.

The backgrounds and heritages here replace the default choices from _Scum and
Villany_, but you can also work with your table to come up with something new if
it excites you.
