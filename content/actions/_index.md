Actions in _Mobile Suits in the Black_ are the same as those in _Scum and
Villainy_, but it's worth a spending a few words on which actions you may want
to roll while piloting a vehicle since so much time will be spent in them (and
most characters, not just people playing the Pilot playbook, will be doing so).

It's not a bad idea to consider taking the Stardancer crew's special ability
**Problem Solvers** to make sure everyone on your crew has a chance to have at
least one dot in **Helm**, which will probably be one of the more important
actions for a mobile suit team.

## Helm

**Helm** is still your go-to for piloting your mobile suit. Nothing to say here
really.

## Skulk

**Skulk** could be used in an MS if you were trying to get around quietly. When
I'm playing _Blades_ or _Scum_, I think of Skulk as your character's aptitude
and instinct for getting around quietly.

The scene in _Gundam Seed_ where the [GAT-X207 Blitz
Gundam](http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/GAT-X207_Blitz_Gundam) uses its camouflage
technology to get inside the defensive perimeter of the Federation's Artemis
base very much feels like Skulk. Same for the scene where Kamille and Quattro
infiltrate Kilimanjaro in their [Hyaku
Shiki](http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/MSN-00100_Hyaku_Shiki) and [Zeta Gundam](http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/MSZ-006_Zeta_Gundam).
