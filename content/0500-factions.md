# The Sponsor Factions

On equal footing with the drama and action of your Soldiers are the politics and
intrigue of the the sponsor Factions in _Against the Titans of War_.

The **Resistance** did not spring from nothing--it is forged from experience and
and desires of many people who have come together to stand against the Enemy.
The sponsor Factions represent the strongest of these--the voices that guide the
**Resistance**'s hand.

Just because these groups fight against the corrupt Enemy does not make them
inherently good. While some support the **Resistance** because it is the right
thing to do, others are here because they see it as a vehicle to ride to further
their own influence and power, a tool they can bend to their own ends.

Each player will create a faction and take on the role of its Tactical officer
to advocate for their interests and goals while planning missions and tactics
for the Resistance.

## Creating a faction

To create a faction, follow these steps:

1. Choose an archetype
2. Decide their goals
3. Decide their shadow
4. Choose a resource they make available to the **Resistance**
5. Choose their closest ally
6. Choose their bitterest enemy

### A note about starting resources...

Even if none of your sponsor factions choose FRACTs or a ship as the resource
they make available to the Resistance, the Resistance will start with basic,
outdated ship and FRACTs, a sponsor just provides _better_ ones.

## MOMENTUM and faction growth

All factions start at **TIER 0**.

Factions will get stronger (or possibly weaker) as you play. When a faction has
10 **MOMENTUM**, they increase TIER by 1. They should choose a new special
ability or resource. Sometimes the MC will require you to run a mission to
secure the resource before it is available.

Conversely, if your faction's MOMENTUM is ever lowered to 0, their TIER
decreases, and they must lose a special ability or resource they sponsor for the
Resistance.

## Tactical Officers

When you step into the Tactical phase of the game, you will be playing a
Tactical Officer who represents one of the Resistance's sponsor factions. This
Officer is one of the faction's most trusted agents, and their goals align with
the faction's.

If at any point your Tactical Officer begins to object to their faction's
actions, consider moving them into the Soldier side of the game. The game's
structure depends on a tension between Tactical and Soldiers.
