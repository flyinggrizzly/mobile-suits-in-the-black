## Example Edges

These are example **Gambits** for your **FRACTs**. You can use them for
inspiration when creating your own, or just use these. They are mostly inspired
by mobile suits from different _Gundam_ series.

<div class='fract-gambit'>
  <strong>Chobham Armor</strong>
  <p>Your FRACT has +4 Damage slots, and the Flaw "Heavy".</p>
  <p>
    At any point, including when you have filled your Damage track and would
    usually have to send your FRACT back to base, you can shed the Chobham
    Armor:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>clear your Damage track</li>
    <li>remove the 4 extra slots</li>
    <li>ignore the "Heavy" flaw until the armor is reapplied</li>
    <li>gain Potency in speed in the ensuing action</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class='fract-gambit'>
  <strong>Funnels</strong>
  <p>
    <strong>When an Envoy sorties in this mobile suit</strong>, they can use the psycommu to
    deploy and control <strong>funnels</strong> or <strong>bits</strong>, which are small remote-controlled
    beam-cannons capable of moving themselves around in space at your mental
    command. <strong>You can spend Stress</strong>, one for one, for any of the following effects:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>attack an enemy from a direction they're not expecting</li>
    <li>attack multiple enemies simultaneously</li>
    <li>create a field of beam-cannon fire to slow a pursuer or quarry down</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="fract-gambit">
  <strong>Heavy Weapons System</strong>
  <p>Your FRACT has +2 Damage slots, +2 Load, and the Flaw "Heavy".</p>
  <p>
    At any point, including when you have filled your Damage track and would
    usually have to send your FRACT back to base, you can shed the Heavy Weapons
    System:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>clear your Damage track</li>
    <li>remove the 2 extra Damage slots</li>
    <li>
      reduce your Load by 2, or if you have declared all or part of the 2 Load,
      choose 2 Load worth of empty slots and gear to leave behind
    </li>
    <li>ignore the "Heavy" flaw until the armor is reapplied</li>
    <li>gain Potency in speed in the ensuing action</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class='fract-gambit'>
  <strong>Ubiquitous</strong>
  <p>
    Zaku are everywhere, and parts and knowhow are easy to find. <strong>When you repair
    your Zaku</strong> spend 1 FN instead of 2 for parts, and tick 1 extra repair box.
  </p>
