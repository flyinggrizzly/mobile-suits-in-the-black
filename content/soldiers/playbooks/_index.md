These are the **Soldier** playbooks for _Against the Titans of War_ which will
give you starting places for the characters you play on the ground.

_Titans_ is a game very focused on what it might be like to be a soldier in a
war, with little influence over what you have to do. Some of these archetypes
focus on that experience--some a little more, and some a little less. Others
focus more on exploring humanity and connection in the midst of conflict. Choose
what interests you.

And, if none of them jump out at you, or you like bits of one and bits of
another... mix it up. If it's just one or two special abilities, take them as
veteran advances. If it's a deeper mash up you want, propose one to your fellow
players. Talk about how people feel about it. Make sure that no one feels like
it might take too much focus on to itself by being a Marty Stu, but otherwise,
go for it!

The playbooks in _Titans_ are...

#### The Ace

is an experienced and dangerous **FRACT** pilot. Play the Ace if you want
to **show off just _how much better_ you are** in your **FRACT** than anyone
else.

#### The Commander

is an officer who leads your squad to execute **Tactical's**
orders, good or bad. Play the Commander if you want to try and **protect your
squad from the worst of Tactical's choices**

#### The Envoy

**yearns to connect and understand with both friend and enemy**
and reaches out with their empathic and psychic power. Play the Envoy if you
want to break the cycle of war by drawing friends and
enemies close to you.

#### The Machinist

is the hands and mind that keep the **FRACTs** running and your
soldiers alive. Play the Machinist if you want to keep the **FRACTs** running
and **invent new tools to win the war and survive**.

#### The ReMade

is an artificial Envoy--created to exploit their power _to
destroy._ Play the ReMade if you want to **lay bare the dark side of
humanity's will to win**, and **be** the most powerful weapon you can.

#### The Rookie

is a young, idealistic soldier assigned to your squad and yet to understand the
real horrors that **Tactical** can enact. Play the Rookie if you want to bring
the **human perspective** from outside the war into its midst.

#### The Veteran

is the oldest member of your squad, and has survived this long because they
understand the only thing keeping them alive is their comrades... so they make
sure they do the same. Play the Veteran if you want to be **thin line between your
comrades and death** when all else has failed.
