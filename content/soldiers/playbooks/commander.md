    Before the start of a mission, you have to make a call. If
    you have the crew attack just there, or at just that time, you'll have an
    edge. Your crew has potency on all actions as long as they follow your
    directives for the mission. But there's a cost... there's always a cost.
    Choose one:

    - Harm that your crew takes during this mission is 1 level higher than it
        would normally be, because you've put them directly in the line of fire.
    - Start the mission with +3 Friction.
    - When you reach 5 Friction on this mission, the enemy deploys an Ace unit
      to take you out.

    You gain potency when you lead a group action. Additionally, suffer 1 less
    stress for failed rolls when leading a group action.
