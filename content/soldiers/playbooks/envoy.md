    When you encounter an obstacle whose true nature is not yet known, you may
    declare that you know that the person really behind it is one of your
    contacts, who is also an Envoy. You feel the pressure of their mind behind
    that door, or around that asteroid. They, of course, sense the your pressure
    on their psyche as well. When acting on this information your position and
    effect are either Desperate-Great, or Controlled-Limited.

    You can push yourself to meet a friend or foe, for a moment uninterrupted,
    in psychic space. You still gain the normal benefits of pushing (additional
    die or increased effect).

For the moment, the Envoy is going to be more a repository of moves for other
playbooks to take as Veteran Advances as your characters develop as Envoys.

In a later version of the game, there might be a fully-fledged Envoy playbook,
but for now it's just a 'moveset'.
