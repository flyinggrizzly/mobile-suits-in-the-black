  description: |
    When you roll Fallout after a mission, you may narrate a letter or journal
    entry your character has written, instead of taking the Fallout rolled.
    Focus on one or two details of the crew's actions in the last mission, and
    reframe them in the context of a new threat--describe how this puts your
    team, or an ally, in the crosshairs. If it's an ally, it can be someone's
    friend, the squad's main contact, or even someone from the squad or
    Tactical. The GM will start a 4-clock for bringing this new threat to bear,
    and tick it once immediately. This counts as the team's Fallout for the
    mission.
