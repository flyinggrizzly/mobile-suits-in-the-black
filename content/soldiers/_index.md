title: Soldiers
weight: 200

When you play _Against the Titans of War_, you will play pilots, mechanics, technicians,
and other soldiers on a FRACT carrier. Each of these characters are unique
individuals, and their own heritages and backgrounds inform their perspectives
on the world and the war.

When you play your Soldiers, you will be rolling dice to take **actions**, and
using your **attributes** to **resist** consequences. [The _Blades in the Dark_
SRD](https://bladesinthedark.com/basics/) has all the information you'll need on
action rolls, position and effect, and the consequences you might suffer, and
how to resist them with your attributes.

There are some changes though. The **actions** in _Against the Titans of War_
are...

| Insight           | Prowess           | Resolve           |
| ---               | ---               | ---               |
| Hunt              | Finesse           | Command           |
| Study             | Skirmish          | Consort           |
| Rig               | Maneuver          | Attune            |
