In addition to playing a **Soldier**, you will also be taking on the role of a
**Tactical Officer**.

**Tactical Officers** do not engage the Enemy directly--they are responsible for
planning the Resistance's strategy to take down the Enemy.

Each **Tactical Officer** is also a member of one of the Resistance's **sponsor
factions**, and will likely have their own more selfish goals in addition to
defeating the Enemy.

## The Tactical phase

The first thing you do when you begin playing _Against the Titans of War_, after
you've finished [creating your characters, the Resistance, the Enemy, and your
factions](#link-to-first-session-rules), is begin your first **Tactical phase**.
Your MC will have some information for you about the Enemy and their goals, and
you will take on the roles of your **Tactical Officers** and decide how the
Resistance responds. You will also return to the **Tactical phase** when you have
resolved [**fallout**](/missions-tier-and-resources/#fallout-entanglements) after each
mission.

In **Tactical phase**, you should follow these steps:

1. Determine each **Tactical Officer's** **STRAT** for the phase
2. Decide on the Resistance's next objective
3. Attach **Riders** to the mission objective
4. Submit **Orders** to the MC

### Determining STRAT

**STRAT** is the currency **Tactical Officers** use to influence the
Resistance's objective and mission parameters. You spend it to attach **Riders**
to a mission objective, and to issue **Orders** to Soldiers or to your faction.

You can use **STRAT** to make sure the Resistance stays on track and has the
best chance of defeating the Enemy... or you can use it selfishly to get the Resistance to
help your own faction into a better position.

To determine your **Tactical Officer's** **STRAT**, roll your current
[**influence**](/tactical/influence/). If your current **influence** is 0, [roll
0d6](https://bladesinthedark.com/core-system#rolling-the-dice) (roll 2d6 and
take the lowest result). Your base **STRAT** is equal to the single highest die
result. If you roll a **crit** (two or more 6s if you have 2 or more
**influence**), take 9 **STRAT**.

You might also have additional **STRAT** from mission **Riders** or **Orders**
that were completed on the last mission.

**STRAT** does not roll over--if you don't use it during the current **Tactical
phase**, it cannot be used in the next one.

Once you have determined your **STRAT**, tell everyone at the table how much
your **Tactical Officer** has. After this, you don't have to tell anyone how
much **STRAT** you have or are spending. It's time to count the cards.

### Deciding on an objective

Discuss an objective for the Resistance to pursue, or a mission to undertake
with the other **Tactical Officers**. This should be some kind of consensus, and
there are no rules for this. The only thing to know is that if the **Tactical
Officers** become deadlocked between two or more plans, anyone can spend
**STRAT** to tip the scales one way or another.

The officer with the most **STRAT** gets the opportunity to do this first, and
the option passes in descending order by **STRAT** count.

If at any point you think your Soldier would find the behavior, politicking,
selfishness, or goals decided by the **Tactical Officers** contemptible, you
make take [**Contempt**](/tactical/contempt/).

### Riders

**Riders** are supplemental mission objectives, or conditions placed on the
squad for achieving or pursuing the main objective. These are **optional** for
the squad, though if any Soldier pursues and achieves one, they **mark 1 XP.**
If a **Rider** is achieved by the squad as a whole (for example, "perform the
exfiltration without leaving any evidence that the Resistance was involved"),
then each Soldier marks 1 XP.

If a Soldier fulfills a **Rider** _alone_ and that Soldier is from the same
faction that placed the **Rider**, they mark 2 XP.

It costs 1 **STRAT** to attach one **Rider** to a mission or goal.

As a**Tactical Officer**, attaching **Riders** to a mission is a good way to
privilege your own faction's benefit over the general benefit of the Resistance
or other sponsor factions. Keep in mind that **Riders** are open knowledge, and
Soldiers may take **Contempt** if they disagree.

### Orders

**Orders** are instructions to the MC to carry out certain actions during the
mission, either at a certain point, or when specific trigger criteria are met.
These can be instructions like **_if_ the Enemy dispatches more than 2 squads to
intercept, _then_ my faction will send in 1 squad to support** or something more
self-serving like **_when_ the Soldiers have secured the prototype, _then_ offer
2 XP to Harding, a Soldier from my faction, to deliver it directly to us and not
the Resistance**.

Unlike **Riders**, **Orders** are submitted blind to the MC, who is in charge of
executing them based on your instructions. This is where your faction can
_really_ maneuver for primacy within the Resistance leadership. It is also the
only way to dispatch support resources to your Soldiers if you think they might
need it, so place your **Orders** wisely.

While a Soldier won't know what **Orders** have been placed until they execute,
they can still take **Contempt** once an **Order** is revealed.

**Orders** can cost from 1 **STRAT** up to 6 **STRAT**:

- an **Order** that executes at a certain time, irregardless of situation costs
    **1 STRAT**
- an **Order** that involves a conditional, like **if... then...** costs **2
    STRAT**. If it looks like the condition won't come up in the mission, you
    can instruct the MC to execute the order at any time by paying **1 STRAT**
    more
- an **Order** that is to a specific Soldier, whether it is conditional or not,
    costs **3 STRAT**. You can offer up to 3 XP to that Soldier for **1 STRAT**
    per XP. These can also be executed at any time for a cost of **1 STRAT**

When deciding **Orders**, every **Tactical Officer** should take an index card,
and write your name, or your faction's name on it, and any orders you have. If
you are not submitting orders, submit an index card with the name and "no
orders" to the MC. These should be given to the MC face down to maintain
secrecy.

### Bookkeeping and overspending STRAT

Once you have announced your total STRAT to the table at the beginning of
**Tactical phase**, you are no longer obligated to be truthful about how much
you have spent or have left. You are welcome to tell everyone, but I encourage
you to keep it close to the chest.

The other **Tactical Officers** will have an idea of how much **STRAT** you have
for issuing **Orders**, but because these are submitted blind, they will know
you've submitted at least 1, but neither how many, nor what kind. Which means
they won't know exactly how much **STRAT** you spend or how much you have left
for changing execution conditions during a mission. Which means you can
**overspend...**

If you **overspend** your **STRAT** and another **Tactical Officer** calls you
on it in the _next_ **Tactical phase**, they can either penalize you that many
**STRAT** for the next phase, or demand you surrender 1 asset per 3 **STRAT**
(rounded up) overspent to the Resistance. You must surrender a minimum of 1
asset. If you do not surrender the asset, your faction takes -1 ongoing to its
**influence** until the rest of the tactical quorum deems your debt repaid.
