Soldiers can take **Contempt** whenever they think someone in command, usually
the **Tactical Officers** (but it can be another Soldier or NPC from a sponsor
faction) is making selfish and bad decisions. Especially when it starts to
endanger the cause or the Soldiers needlessly.

A Soldier either has **Contempt**. You can't have 'two contempt'. When you take
**Contempt**, keep track of which faction angered you enough to do this--when
you spend it this will be important.

Spending **Contempt** ratchets up the tension in the Resistance, and you will
mark the [**Tension track**](/tactical/tension-crisis/). When the **Tension
track** is full, you are in [**Crisis**](/tactical/tension-crisis#crises).

## Using Contempt

You can use your **Contempt** when you are in the field. It is a strong and ugly
emotion that can burn inside your Soldier and carry them through, so they can
see some kind of justice served. Or not.

When you have **Contempt**, you can spend it to

- pay any amount of Stress at any time (pushing, resisting, aiding)
- increase the effect level of an action
- change the outcome of an action roll by one level
- mark 2 XP

When you spend **Contempt**, the faction whose actions caused you to take it
marks a 1 **STRAT** penalty for the next **Tactical phase**, and the Resistance
marks the **Tension track** once.

#### Paying Stress

At any point, if you are about to mark Stress, you can spend a **Contempt** to
avoid paying the Stress cost.

#### Increasing level of effect

You can spend a **Contempt** to bump the outcome of your successful action by one
level: from **Limited** to **Standard**, or from **Standard** to **Great**. You
can do this before or after the action has been taken.

#### Changing the outcome of an action roll

Once the dice for an action have been rolled, you can spend **Contempt** to
adjust the result up _or_ down. This means you can turn a 1-3 into a 4/5, a 4/5
into a 1-3 or 6, and a 6 into a 4/5 or Crit.

This can be for your own action, or if it would be narratively possible for you
to have aided or interfered with another Soldier, with their action. If you are
reducing another player's result, you should talk this through with them.
_Blades in the Dark_ has good guidelines for handling inter-character conflict,
paraphrased and adapted here for interfering with a roll:

1. Pause and breathe--these are the characters in conflict, not you yourselves
2. Agree about if this is OK
3. Abide by the decision

Chances are if you're spending **Contempt** to interfere with another
character's action, you should already have been trying to interfere or talk
them down. Spending **Contempt** like this should be part of your story and
exciting in and of itself, not a tool for ruining someone's fun.

If the other player is not comfortable with you using your **Contempt** this
way, don't. Find another use for it. There are other really good uses for it.

#### Mark 2 XP

Sometimes it takes getting burned to learn and grow. You can spend your
**Contempt** to just take whatever betrayal gave it to you on the chin and learn
something new. Mark 2 Playbook XP.
