title: Against the Titans of War
---

_Against the Titans of War_ is a [_Forged in the
Dark_](https://bladesinthedark.com/licensing) game that puts you in the middle
of a seemingly endlessly escalating series of wars and conflicts waged with
machines called **FRACTS**. You play as the Resistance, fighting against a corrupt
army who controls Earth and space. They are the Enemy.

It is a game for 4 to 5 players. All but one of you will take on the role of
both Soldiers, and Strategic Officers. The other will be the game's MC[^1].

When you are playing your Soldier, you will take to the battlefield, both on
foot and in your **FRACT**. It is the Soldier's job to deliver on the orders and
designs of the Tacticians.

When you are in the role of your Tactician, you represent one of the
factions sponsoring the Resistance. It is your job to guide the Resistance's
plans and choices towards success... whether that's the Resistance's success or
your own faction's is up to you to choose.

[^1]: Prefer "MC" over "GM" because this is a primarily collaborative game, and
  the MC role should be as focused on stage-managing the work of the rest of the
  players and world as on creating it.
