title: Mobile Suit Gundam::Forged in the Dark
---

_Mobile Suits in the Black_ is a [_Forged in the
Dark_](https://bladesinthedark.com/licensing) game that puts you in the middle
of one of the conflicts in the early Universal Century timeline of the Mobile
Suit Gundam series.

Actually... that's a little bit of a lie. This is really a playset for [Scum and
Villainy](https://www.evilhat.com/home/scum-and-villainy/), an _excellent_ game
by Stras Acimovic and John LeBoeuf-Little. You'll need _SaV_ to play this.

_MSitB_ makes the following changes to _SaV_:

- changes for characters
  - adds some playbooks, and makes some suggestions about which _SaV_ playbooks
    will work well with the new ones (pending)
  - provides some Veteran Advance movesets for discovering your character's
    latent Newtype abilities, or for expressing the powers awakened in them when
    they were made into a Cyber Newtype (pending)
  - provides some new backgrounds and heritages
- provides some guidelines for creating mobile suits from the Mobile Suit Gundam
  series' as personal vehicles
- provides a faction list for the Earth Sphere during the early UC (pending)
