## Game influences

The [Twilight Mirage
season](https://friendsatthetable.libsyn.com/category/Twilight+Mirage) of
[Friends at the Table](http://friendsatthetable.cash), for showing me I could
use _Scum and Villany_ to do awesome giant robot shit.

[_Armour Astir_](https://tinyurl.com/armourastir) by
[weregazelle](https://twitter.com/weregazelle), for being an amazing giant robot
and hard feelings game. Basically, everything I'm doing here is done better
there ;)
