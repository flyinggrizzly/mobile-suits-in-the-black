## Game influences

The [Twilight Mirage
season](https://friendsatthetable.libsyn.com/category/Twilight+Mirage) of
[Friends at the Table](http://friendsatthetable.cash), for showing me I could
use _Scum and Villainy_ to do awesome giant robot shit.

[_Armour Astir_](https://tinyurl.com/armourastir) by
[weregazelle](https://twitter.com/weregazelle), for being an amazing giant robot
and hard feelings game. Basically, everything I'm doing here is done better
there ;)

[_Girl by Moonlight_](http://192.168.0.10:3000/cd93da64-c935-48dc-bf7c-28f20304e9b5#),
a _Forged in the Dark_ game in development by [Andrew
Gillis](https://twitter.com/commutingcrow). They have created a really beautiful
game, and the way they have broken apart and reworked the core _Blades_ formula
has been a huge part of what made me want to try reworking the game as well. The
drama, hope, and sorrow that drips out of this game is beautiful. Plus, the _On
a Sea of Stars_ version is about giant mecha too.

The **Friction** track and the **Commander**'s Hard Choices move both come from
[_The Sprawl_](http://www.ardens.org/games/the-sprawl/) by Hamish Cameron.
Specifically, Friction is an adaptation of the Action Clock, and Hard Choices
comes from The Soldier playbook's Here's the Plan move.
