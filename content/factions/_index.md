On equal footing with the drama and action of your Soldiers are the politics and
intrigue of the the sponsor Factions in _Against the Titans of War_.

The **Resistance** did not spring from nothing--it is forged from experience and
and desires of many people who have come together to stand against the Enemy.
The sponsor Factions represent the strongest of these--the voices that guide the
**Resistance**'s hand.

Just because these groups fight against the corrupt Enemy does not make them
inherently good. While some support the **Resistance** because it is the right
thing to do, others are here because they see it as a vehicle to ride to further
their own influence and power, a tool they can bend to their own ends.

Each player will create a faction and take on the role of its
**[Tactical officer](/tactical/tactical-officers/)**.

## Creating factions

To create a faction, follow these steps:

1. Choose an archetype
2. Decide their goals
3. Decide their shadow
4. Choose a resource they make available to the **Resistance**
5. Choose their closest ally
6. Choose their bitterest enemy

### Archetypes

A faction's archetype is the biggest determining factor in who they are and how
they operate. It is their playbook.

The [**Objectors**](/factions/archetypes/objectors/) are people from the same
organization as the Enemy, who will not stand for what is happening.

The [**Resurgent Defeated**](/factions/archetypes/resurgent-defeated/) are the
losers of the **Last War**, hunted by the Enemy. Their hate burns hotter than
anyone else's.

The [**Corporate Atlas**](/factions/archetypes/corporate-atlas/) is a private
company who supports the **Resistance** both financially and with materiel,
either out of good intention or because the Enemy has blacklisted them from
their market.

#### Choosing a resource to start

To begin with, choose one resource from your faction's list that you make
available to the **Resistance**. The Resistance will start with a basic,
outdated ship and **FRACT**s, but a faction can provide better ones.

## MOMENTUM and faction growth

All factions start at **TIER 0**.

Factions will get stronger (or possibly weaker) as you play. When a faction has
10 **MOMENTUM**, they increase TIER by 1. They should choose a new special
ability or resource. Sometimes the MC will require you to run a mission to
secure the resource before it is available.

Conversely, if your faction's MOMENTUM is ever lowered to 0, their TIER
decreases, and they must lose a special ability or resource they sponsor for the
Resistance.
