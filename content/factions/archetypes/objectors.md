title: the Objectors
---

The **Objectors** are people from the same organization as the Enemy, who will
not stand for what is happening.


## Drives

- return to the status quo before the corruption got so bad we had to act
- protect the innocent
- redeem ourselves and what we stand for from the taint of the Enemy


## Shadows

- not everything the Enemy does is unreasonable
- maybe working with some people in from the Enemy we could change them from the
  inside or through dialog

## Resources

- intelligence assets
- equipment and materiel
- experienced soldiers and commanders
