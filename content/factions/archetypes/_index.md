title: Faction Archetypes

Each sponsor faction will have an archetype, which gives some options for their
**drive**, **shadow**, and the resources they can offer the Resistance.

It is perfectly fine to have more than 1 faction of the same archetype, though
it's a good idea to have at least 2 or three types in your game.
