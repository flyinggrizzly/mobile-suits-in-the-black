Use the crews from _Scum and Villainy_. There is, however, one major change that
_Mobile Suits in the Black_ makes: all crews **start** with the **Personal
vehicles** upgrade from the **Cerberus** crew.

Additionally, the **Stardancer**'s **Problem Solvers** special ability is not
considered a veteran crew advance. It's important that all characters have
access to the **Helm** action more freely.

## Planned changes

At some point, when the game ceases to be just a hack of _Scum and Villainy_, we
can probably look forward to crew sheets looking a little more like stock
_Blades_--a map of claims to be made by the crew.

These might be milestones in the journey to Jaburo, or political wins like
securing the cooperation of Axis against the Titans, or strategic victories like
the Gundam Meisters or Operation Meteor destroying weapons factories.

For each of these, the crew will declare what will be gained if the mission is a
success, and _stake a current asset or claim against its failure_. This is what
you will lose if you fail.

When a crew begins, the players as a group will _narrate_ episode one. This is
the story of how you came to be the crew you are, and how you gained your first
claim. If you think of the first episodes of _Mobile Suit Gundam_, where the
crew of the White Base finds themselves the unlikely crew of a carrier, or
_Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam_, where Bajeena's Rick Dias team steals the Gundam Mark
II, that should give you a good idea. This is your first claim, and it is the
thing you _must_ stake during your first mission. And if you lose it in the
fallout of that mission... your struggle continues, but you will have to figure
out how to get back on your feet.
