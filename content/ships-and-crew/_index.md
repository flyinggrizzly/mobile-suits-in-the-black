Use the crews from _Scum and Villainy_. There is, however, one major change that
_Mobile Suits in the Black_ makes: all crews **start** with the **Personal
vehicles** upgrade from the **Cerberus** crew.

Additionally, the **Stardancer**'s **Problem Solvers** special ability is not
considered a veteran crew advance. It's important that all characters have
access to the **Helm** action more freely.
