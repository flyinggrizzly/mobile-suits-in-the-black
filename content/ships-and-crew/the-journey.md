title: The Journey
shipDescription: |
  An ark of survivors, refugees, or fugitives running towards ever-retreating
  safety. Examples include the _White Base_ from _Mobile Suit Gundam_, Anavel
  Gato on the run from the _Albion_ after stealing the GP-02 in _Mobile Suit
  Gundam 0083: Stardust Memories_ (or any Zeon group at the end of the One Year
  War), and the _Archangel_ from _Mobile Suit Gundam: Seed_.
type: ship

  tier_1:
    - name: ship
      description: |
        The ship you call home, your fragile refuge. It could be an aging
        freighter or transport you managed to pilot away from the disaster that
        left you on the run, or a secret military ship you boarded as a last
        resort and are now conscripted to crew. Whatever it is, it is not just
        you aboard--there are many other refugees who cannot or will not fight.
        Name some now, and be ready to give more names later as you find your
        characters interacting with them. Give your ship a name, describe
        it and how you all came to be aboard, and decide these as a  crew:

        - what makes it welcoming
        - what makes it frightening
        - who the strongest are among you (this might be, but does not have to
            be the PCs)
        - who the weakest among you are
        - how it is strong
        - how it is vulnerable
        - why it makes you vulnerable
    - name: Mobile Suit complement
      description: |
        Each PC chooses a mobile suit that is either a mass-production or
        performance unit. You can choose either regardless of what your ship is,
        but be prepared to explain why and how you have a cutting edge
        performance mobile suit if you're on an old freighter. And remember,
        performance mobile suits are stronger but will be harder to maintain.

        You cannot gain this resource a second time.

        You are running out of a vital resource--food, water, salt, oxygen...
        whatever it is, its lack will kill you just as surely as those who hunt
        you. When you roll this fallout, start a 4-clock, and tick it
        immediately, and each downtime until you find a way to solve this
        shortage. When the clock fills the most vulnerable among you begin to
        die--make a fortune roll, and on a 1-3 name one of the NPCs on your ship
        and say why the shortage killed them.

This crew book focuses a lot on the people aboard your ship. It is very much a
book about building and protecting a community.

As a GM, populate the ship with many different people with different
perspectives. Not all of them have to want to be there, but they are all reliant
on the PCs for protection. Put these people under threat, and follow through
when the characters can't intervene.

As a player, be sure to involve the other people on the ship, and know that they
are relying on you for their safety.

This crew book also has a lot of resources that expand what the ship can do. If
the ship is a cutting edge military ship like the _White Base_, it might be
strange to mount a mission to get the **Turrets** resource. That mission though
might be more about the people crewing those turrets learning how to use them
under fire, rather than just acquiring and installing the turrets like you might
do with an old freighter. Bear that in mind when staking your resources as well.
