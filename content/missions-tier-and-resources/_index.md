title: Missions, Tier, and Resources

- tier: 0, 1, 2, or 3
  - every 6 value in assets is 1 tier
- resource missions (where you are aiming to get a new resource):
  - you always fail the engagement roll
  - if you name one resource you are relying on for this mission, you get 0d6
    for the mission. Punching up is hard.
  - declare a number of resources whose value sum is equal to the value of
    your target. This is your stake for the mission, and brings you to 1d6 for
    the engagement roll. If you fail the mission, you will likely lose _all_ of
    these resources.
  - you can stake additional resources to increase your Tier for this mission,
    gaining 1 Tier for every 2 resource points
  - as long as you've staked enough for the mission, you can call on friends and
    allies for the mission as usual. If your stake doesn't meet the mission take
    cost, no number of friends helping will raise your engagement above 0d6
- regular missions:
  - fail engagement until you name a critical resource for the mission, gets you
    0d6
  - stake resources for increase in Tier, at 2 resource points per 1 Tier
  - call on friends and other advantages to augment the engagement roll as usual

## Friction

During a mission you accrue Friction when you roll 1-3 on a Desperate action,
or as possible consequence of any other action.

When you reach 5, 8, and 10 Friction your target escalates the conflict. Maybe
they call in an ace unit, or launch a strike directly at one of your staked
resources, or maybe even escalate the scope of the conflict (firing a Colony
Laser, for example).

Your Friction resets to 0 at the end of downtime.

## Fallout/Entanglements

Roll your crew's tier instead of Wanted level for fallout. Your tier is your
visibility to the enemy.

Once you have rolled your Tier, find the entry for the result on the Fallout
table based on the Friction you accrued during the mission.

Sometimes a Fallout result won't be enabled when you roll it. If this happens
use the fallout result of the same number from the next table down. For example,
The Resistance might have racked up 9 Friction during a mission and then rolled
a 5 for Fallout. This would be the **Leaks** result, but if they haven't yet
gained the **Materiel supplier** resource, they would instead choose the 5 from
the 6-8 Friction table, **Rival Trouble**.

Something to do with entanglements, maybe?

- lose a staked resource
- damage a staked resource
- something to do with allies
- something to highlight divisions within the crew
