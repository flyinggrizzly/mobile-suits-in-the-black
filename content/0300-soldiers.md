# Soldiers

Your Soldier is one of two main characters you will be spending your time with
when you play _Argama_.

Your Soldier will be a character based on a playbook or class from the game you
pair _Argama_ with. You should follow that game's rules for creating your
Soldiers. As you do, keep in mind the following:

- your Soldier should be fully invested in acting towards the Resistance goals,
    though they may have personal doubts
- don't pick a playbook that is too heavily invested in pastoral play,
    like the Baron for _Dungeon World_ or the Hardholder for _Apocalypse World_.
    You're likely not going to get much opportunity to exercise the most
    interesting parts of those playbooks when _Argama's_ Tactical Officers start
    handing you missions (though there's no reason you can't play someone who
    _used_ to be a Hardholder!)
- the Squad that your Soldiers are in is one of the Resistance's ace squads. You
    should all think about how your characters will work together
