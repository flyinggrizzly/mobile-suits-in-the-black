**FRACTs** are the giant humanoid machines that your Soldiers can pilot in the war.
You don't have to pilot these--in fact, it is entirely possible to play _Against
the Titans of War_ without these massive mecha existing in your world at all.
But if you want to... this is how you create and use a **FRACT**.

## FRACT categories

**FRACTs** fall into one of 3 categories:

- mass-produced units
- performance units
- ace custom units

When you begin the game, you will probably be piloting mass-produced FRACTs, or
possibly one or two performance units if you have an Ace in your squad.

The differences between the different categories are the number of **Edges**,
**Flaws**, and **Gambits**[^1] they have, and how much it costs to keep them
running:

| Class           | Edges | Flaws | Gambits | Repair cost |
| ---             | ---   | ---   | ---     | ---         |
| Mass-produced   | 2     | 2     | 1       | 2 FN        |
| Performance     | 2     | 2     | 2       | 4 FN        |
| Ace (option a)  | 3     | 1     | 2       | 6 FN        |
| Ace (option b)  | 3     | 2     | 3       | 6 FN        |

## Creating a FRACT

One of my favorite parts of this is creating my FRACT--there's a lot of story
that you can tell with the edges, flaws, and gambits you give your machine.

Create your FRACTs as a group--talk through what you all are thinking. Is each
FRACT a unique piece? What does it mean for it to be 'mass-produced' in that
case? Or, if it's off of an assembly line, do all of you pilot the same model,
with only small modifications? If so, maybe you all have the same Edges and
Flaws, but your Gambit is where you show your own personal flair.

### Edges

Edges are characteristics of your FRACT where it excels. Fast, strong,
relentless, quiet are all good choices--these should be adjectives or traits
that can give you advantage.

When you are performing an action in your FRACT and it aligns with one of the
FRACT's Edges, take +1d or improved effect, your choice..

If you are looking for more inspiration, there is a list of [example
Edges](/fracts/example-edges/).

### Flaws

The opposite of Edges, Flaws are traits of your FRACT that are dangerous, the
places where it is easily outclassed. Things like slow, ponderous, loud, clumsy,
recognizable are all good flaws.

When you are taking an action that aligns with one of your FRACT's Flaws, take
-1d or reduced effect (your choice).

Flaws](/fracts/example-flaws/).

### Flaws as Edges, Edges as Flaws

There might arise situations where a trait that is usually a Flaw can be an
Edge--''recognizable', for example, could me made to work in your favor. When this
is the case, take the windfall, because it will probably bite you even harder
next time.

On the other hand, when an Edge would work against you, take that penalty. If
you are trying to be delicate, and your 'vicious' Edge can cause you problems...
take it on the chin.

There's maybe some strategy in choosing Edges and Flaws that can double as both.
If you do, just be honest about both traits. Don't be a weasel and only take
flexible Flaws.

### Gambits

**Gambits** are like special abilities that you only have access to while
piloting your FRACT. In mecha anime, the machines themselves have certain
character and nudge their pilots to behave in certain ways. Edges and Flaws
already get us part of the way there, but it's your FRACT's Gambits that really
drive this.

When creating a Gambit, think about what you would like your FRACT to be
exception at. Things like "when it is surrounded, it can move fast enough to
attack all the enemies at once for a split second", or "when it transforms, it
is the fastest and most maneuverable machine on the field" are good places to
start.

Once you have the core idea, it's time to turn it into a Gambit. The more
generally applicable the trigger is, the less spectacular the Gambit should be.
For example, if I were making a gambit for the [Zaku
II](http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/MS-06_Zaku_II), the most common mobile suit
from the _Gundam_ series, I might give it this gambit:

> **Ubiquitous**

> Zaku are everywhere, and parts and knowhow are easy to find. **When you repair
> your Zaku** spend 1 FN instead of 2 for parts, and tick 1 extra repair box.

It's not the most glamorous, exciting, or rule-bending Gambit, but on the other
hand, FRACTs will need to be repaired almost every mission, so this Gambit will
always be useful.

On the other hand, if I were making a Gambit for the Qubeley from Zeta...

> **Funnels**

> **When an Envoy sorties in this mobile suit**, they can use the psycommu to
> deploy and control **funnels** or **bits**, which are small remote-controlled
> beam-cannons capable of moving themselves around in space at your mental
> command. **You can spend Stress**, one for one, for any of the following effects:
>
> - attack an enemy from a direction they're not expecting
> - attack multiple enemies simultaneously
> - create a field of beam-cannon fire to slow a pursuer or quarry down

This is a much more 'powerful' Gambit, and so has a higher cost (Stress)
associated with it. It's also more restricted in its use--only Soldiers using
the Envoy playbook can really make use of it.

## Maintaining a FRACT



[^1]: For those of you who have played _Scum and Villainy_, FRACT gambits are not the same as gambits in that game.
