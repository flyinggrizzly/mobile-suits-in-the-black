These are example **Gambits** for your **FRACTs**. You can use them for
inspiration when creating your own, or just use these. They are mostly inspired
by mobile suits from different _Gundam_ series[^1].

The process I've followed for creating these is to identify some _thing_ that
the FRACT can do, that sets it apart from other FRACTs. In Gundam terms, things
like the Zeta's ability to transform, or its Biocomputer, or the Zaku's
workhorse reliability, or the Guncannon's heavy firepower--these are all things
that lend the mobile suit its character.

Once you know what trait of the FRACT you'd like to focus, think about how you
can break specific rules of the game to make that a reality both in the
narrative, and in the crunch: for example, a Zaku's reliability might make it
easier and cheaper to repair, so consider reducing repair cost and giving a
bonus die or even an extra tick on the repair clock. For the Guncannon, it might
be that you can **push** to lay down a heavy barrage, and damage either several
enemies or one or two very powerful enemies with improved effect.

Common Gambit formula include:

- **push** for some extra effect in addition to the extra die or improved
    position in a tense position
- an extra die and/or effect (or clock tick for long-term projects) in less
    tense situations
- something more powerful, like extra armor or load in exchange for taking an
    extra **Flaw**
- something special you can do by expending your **special armor**

If you need inspiration, the core _Blades_ playbook special abilities are great.

## Examples

### Chobham Armor or Heavy Weapons System

Your FRACT has +3 Damage slots, and the Flaw "Heavy".

When you fill your Damage track, you can shed the Chobham Armor. When you do,
clear your Damage track, remove the 3 extra slots, and ignore the "Heavy" flaw.

Instead of Chobham Armor, you may take a Heavy Weapons System. If you do, only
add +2 Damage slots, but also add +2 Load. When you shed the HWS, in addition
to clearing Damage, dropping the Damage slots, and ignoring the "Heavy" Flaw,
you also lose access to the extra Load.
