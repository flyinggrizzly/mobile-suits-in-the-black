  - **Hard choices**: before the start of a mission, you have to make a call. If
      you have the crew attack just there, or at just that time, you'll have an
      edge. Your crew has potency on their actions as long as the follow your
      directives for the mission. But there's a cost... there's always a cost.
      Choose one:
      - Harm that your crew takes during this mission is 1 level higher than it
          would normally be, because you've put them directly in the line of fire.
      - The GM starts a 6-clock, which they will fill as the mission proceeds
          (most likely on failed rolls). When it is full, the enemy's elite
          reinforcements arrive. They outclass you, even with your tactical
          edge.
  - **Shrewd command**: You gain potency when you lead a group action.
      Additionally, suffer 1 less stress for failed rolls.
